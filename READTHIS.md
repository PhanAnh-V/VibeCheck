# VibeCheck - Firebase App Hosting Deployment Context

## � CURRENT STATUS: DEPLOYMENT FAILING
**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Problem**: Firebase App Hosting deployment shows "Service Unavailable" after multiple attempts  
**URL**: https://my-web-app--vibecheckapp-52d16.asia-east1.hosted.app  

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT HISTORY & ATTEMPTS

### What Works ✅
- **Flask App Locally**: Runs perfectly on `python3 app.py` (port 5000)
- **Firebase CLI**: Authenticated as hoagahphan@gmail.com, project `vibecheckapp-52d16`
- **Git Repository**: Connected to `PhanAnh-V/StudentVibe` 
- **Continuous Deployment**: Set up on `firebase-deploy-clean` branch

### What's Been Tried ❌
1. **Node.js Express Approach**: Created Express proxy server → 503 errors
2. **Node.js + Python Hybrid**: Tried running Python from Node.js → Failed
3. **Python-Only Approach**: Removed Node.js, added Procfile/runtime.txt → Service Unavailable
4. **Multiple Buildpack Attempts**: Tried various configurations → None work

## 🏗️ CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE

### Core Flask Application
- **`app.py`**: Main Flask application (873 lines) - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **`main.py`**: Entry point that calls `create_app()` from app.py
- **`routes.py`**: All Flask routes (2180 lines) - Complete functionality
- **`models.py`**: SQLAlchemy models (Student, Squad, SessionSettings)
- **`forms.py`**: Flask-WTF forms for student/teacher login
- **`config.py`**: Flask configuration
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies (Flask, Firebase Admin, OpenAI, etc.)

### Templates & Static Files
- **`templates/`**: 15+ HTML templates including:
  - `new_index.html`: Main landing page with student/teacher login
  - `questionnaire.html`: Multi-language personality questionnaire
  - `organizer_dashboard.html`: Teacher dashboard for squad management
  - `squad_hub.html`: Student squad interface
- **`static/`**: CSS, JS, images for the web interface

### Firebase Configuration Files
- **`apphosting.yaml`**: Firebase App Hosting config (currently Python-focused)
- **`firebase.json`**: Firebase project configuration
- **`serviceAccountKey.json`**: Firebase Admin SDK credentials

### Deployment Files (Currently Not Working)
- **`package.json`**: Minimal config pointing to Python app
- **`Procfile`**: `web: python main.py` 
- **`runtime.txt`**: `python-3.11`
- **`requirements.txt`**: All Python dependencies listed

## 🎯 WHAT THE APP DOES (When Working)

### VibeCheck Features
1. **Multi-language Support**: English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese
2. **Student Portal**: Personality questionnaire with 15+ questions
3. **Teacher Dashboard**: AI-powered squad formation based on personality analysis
4. **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and data storage
5. **OpenAI Integration**: AI analysis for optimal group formation

### Key Routes (from routes.py)
- `/`: Language selection page
- `/session-password`: Session authentication
- `/student-login`: Student authentication
- `/teacher-login`: Teacher dashboard access  
- `/questionnaire`: Personality assessment form
- `/recommendations`: AI-generated squad suggestions

## � **KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS**

### Firebase App Hosting Limitations
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Firebase App Hosting appears to be **primarily designed for Node.js applications**. 

Evidence:
- Multiple Python deployment attempts all fail with "Service Unavailable"
- Buildpack detection consistently fails for Python
- Official examples and documentation focus on Node.js/Next.js
- Community reports suggest Python support is limited/experimental

### Recommended Alternative Approaches
1. **Google Cloud Run** - Direct container deployment, full Python support
2. **Firebase Functions** - Serverless Python functions (different from App Hosting)
3. **Heroku/Railway** - Better Python buildpack support
4. **Docker + Cloud Run** - Containerized deployment with guaranteed compatibility

## �🔧 FIREBASE APP HOSTING ISSUES

### Current Problem
Firebase App Hosting is not detecting/building the Python application correctly:
- Buildpack detection failing
- Service shows as unavailable  
- No proper error logs accessible
- Multiple deployment approaches all fail

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Buildpack Detection**: Firebase may not recognize this as a Python app
2. **Missing Files**: May need specific files for Firebase App Hosting
3. **Configuration Issues**: apphosting.yaml may be incorrect
4. **Port Configuration**: Flask app runs on 5000, Firebase expects 8080
5. **Dependencies**: Some Python packages may not install properly

## 📚 RESEARCH NEEDED

### Firebase App Hosting Requirements
- What files are required for Python apps?
- How does buildpack detection work?
- Is there a specific structure needed?
- Are there Python runtime limitations?

### Alternative Approaches
- Should we use Cloud Run directly instead?
- Would Docker containerization work better?
- Is there a simpler Firebase hosting option?

## 💡 NEXT STEPS FOR NEW AI SESSION

1. **Research Firebase App Hosting Python requirements** - Find official docs
2. **Check buildpack detection issues** - Why isn't Python being detected?
3. **Review successful Python deployments** - Find working examples
4. **Consider alternative deployment methods** - Cloud Run, Container Registry
5. **Test minimal Python app first** - Before deploying full Flask app

## 🎯 ULTIMATE GOAL
Deploy the fully functional VibeCheck Flask application to a publicly accessible URL where:
- Students can take personality questionnaires
- Teachers can form AI-optimized squads
- Multi-language interface works properly
- Firebase authentication is integrated

**Repository**: https://github.com/PhanAnh-V/StudentVibe  
**Current Branch**: firebase-deploy-clean

### **Testing Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Playwright E2E Tests**: Installed and configured
- ✅ **Test Server**: `test_server.py` works correctly 
- ✅ **Basic Validation**: 2/2 tests pass (server startup + route functionality)

## 🔑 **Environment Configuration**
```python
# Working environment variables (manual setup)
SECRET_KEY = 'dev-secret-key-for-flask-sessions'
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-proj-...' (valid key)
FIREBASE_API_KEY = 'your-firebase-api-key-here'
```

## 🚀 **Next Development Priorities**

1. **Fix Firebase Functions**: Complete Python environment setup for dynamic routes
2. **Database Migration**: Move from SQLite to Cloud Firestore/SQL
3. **Production Environment**: Secure API keys and production configuration
4. **Feature Development**: Enhanced UI/UX, admin features, analytics

## 💡 **Key Technical Notes**
- **Routing Issue**: Must use `create_app()` function, not direct `app` import
- **Environment**: Dotenv hangs, use manual env var setting
- **Testing**: Playwright setup complete, ready for comprehensive E2E testing
- **Deployment**: Firebase hosting works, functions need environment fix

## 🎛️ **How to Run the App**

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Start the app locally
cd /workspaces/StudentVibe
python3 test_server.py
# App runs on http://localhost:5001
```

### **Testing**
```bash
# Run basic tests
python -m pytest tests/test_simple.py -v

# Run E2E tests (when server issues resolved)
python -m pytest tests/test_e2e.py -v
```

### **Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting  # Static files only (working)
firebase deploy --only functions # Needs environment fix
```

## 🚧 **Known Issues & Workarounds**

1. **Dotenv Hanging**: Use manual environment variable setting instead of `load_dotenv()`
2. **Route Registration**: Always use `create_app()`, never import `app` directly
3. **Firebase Functions**: Python environment needs proper setup for deployment
4. **Database Persistence**: SQLite works locally but needs cloud solution for production

## 📊 **Current App Status**
- **Local Development**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Static Hosting**: ✅ Deployed to Firebase
- **Dynamic Functions**: ⚠️ Needs environment configuration
- **Database**: ✅ Working locally (SQLite)
- **AI Integration**: ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 connected
- **Testing**: ✅ Basic tests pass, E2E infrastructure ready

The app is **functional locally** and **partially deployed**. Core functionality works, deployment pipeline established, ready for iterative development and fixes.
